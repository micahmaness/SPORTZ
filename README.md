# SPORTZ
 ### Weekly NBA game prediction using Tensorflow and python
 
 ## Project Overview:
 > Our goal with SPORTZ is to be able to predict the outcome of NBA games week by week using the Tensorflow neural network library. By using game statistics from previous seasons we are able to import that into our ANN and formulate predictions. We are also integrating NBA_API from the python library to pull up to date statistics on games that have recently been played.
